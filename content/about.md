Hello there, I am Akash, a research fellow and incoming PhD candidate at the Multi-Robot System Group, Czech Technical University in Prague. And in the spirit of every programmer out there, this ReadMe is also copied from somewhere (from one of my friends, btw. Et Tu Brute?).

### - ðŸ¤– What do I do? 
#### Research Interests
 - My primary research interest is Human-Swarm Interaction. I work on enabling humans to work with robots, specifically UAVs, to perform certain tasks. I work with Swarm control, vision, signal propagation, and communication within a swarm. 
 - I am also a game designer, so I use Unity or Unreal Engine to make simulations that researchers can use to test their systemsâ€”currently working on a long-term project in the same domain. 
 - One of the things that I absolutely love is 3D designing. I routinely use Blender for 3D modeling and Solidworks for CAD. I don't just model; I design things that can be manufactured and deployed. My experience in designing cars and ground robots helped me develop this skill. 
 - I have previously worked with Autonomous Ground Robots and Underwater robots as well. 
 - And I did some work in Cosmology for a short while, but we don't talk about that. 
 
 #### What do I know? 
 - Robot Operating System
- Simulation: Unity3D, ANSYS, Simulink, Cadence Virtuoso
- Programming Languages: Python, C++, C, MATLAB, C#, Java, HTML, CSS
- Design: Solidworks, Blender, AutoCAD, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Proteus, Eagle CAD
- Others: OpenCV, Arduino IDE, Hugo, Git, Latex


### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
#### Languages
- C++     (New to this, but a guy can try. I use it for both my robot systems and Unreal Engine programming)
- Python  (I guess the best calculator out there. Anyway, I use it for vision and data analysis projects)
- C# - (For obvious reasons, my GitHub will suggest that I am really experienced with C#, but the reality is that I made a lot of applications in Unity. )

#### Directions for development
- Robotics
- Human-Swarm Cooperation
- ALternate Robot Designs
