Robotic arms are used to perform tasks, which require great precision and accuracy. They are used in various sectors of industry to automate a certain process to increase productivity and quality of a product. In the future, they can be used to perform medical operations and be used in humanoid robots, which can interact with humans. They are used in environments, which are inaccessible to humans like operating in a remote environment like in outer space or to an extraterrestrial body to conduct research. International Space Station and Mars rovers like curiosity and rover twins are its great examples. We will be using electric linear actuators for actuation of robotic links. A worm gear assembly will be used for base rotation and a bevel gearbox at gripper to provide its 2 DOF.


The arm that we are building is capable of lifting a payload of upto 7Kgs, perform various tasks such as operating a joystick, type on a keyboard etc. The primary goal of our project is to build an autonomous robotic arm for the rover being built by Team Kratos for University Rover Challenge. In the future they can be used to perform certain medical procedures which requires a lot of precision and accuracy. They can also be used by disabled people to perform certain tasks which will help them to become independent upto a certain extent. They can also be used by the military for bomb defusal, which can save countless precious lives
